# Initiative: Set up the CI/CD DevOps processes to ensure efficient and collaborative development practices.
## Description: 
As a development team, set up the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) DevOps processes efficiently and collaboratively develop, test, and deploy software. By using an agile lean approach, we aim to streamline our software development lifecycle and improve collaboration and communication among all team members.

## Epics
* Automated testing to catch issues early on and adapt to changing requirements
* Automated deployment of the current development branch to team members local environments to facilitate manual review

## Test Plan
This will be tested by verifying that the version control system, build and deployment automation, automated testing framework, continuous feedback and improvement process, and culture of collaboration and communication are all successfully implemented and functioning as intended, resulting in a streamlined software development lifecycle.
