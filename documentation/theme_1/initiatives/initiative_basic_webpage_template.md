# Initiative: Develop initial project documentation to establish a clear project scope.
## Description: 
The objective of this initiative is to develop initial project documentation that clearly outlines the project scope, goals, and objectives. This documentation will help the team to establish a shared understanding of the project, and ensure that everyone is aligned on the direction of the project.
## Epics
* Project Scope Documentation
* Project Scope Refinement
## Test plan
This will be tested by reviewing and refining the project documentation, testing the accuracy of deliverables, timeline, budget, communication, and stakeholder alignment, and ensuring that the project stays within the allocated budget and progresses on schedule.
