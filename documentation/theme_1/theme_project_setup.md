# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles to quickly and effectively
develop a strong foundation for our web project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish a
solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project, setting
us up for long-term success.
